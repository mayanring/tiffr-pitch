      <p>Rushline is a festival planning app for film lovers, industry professionals, and festival organizers.</p>

    </section>

    <h1>What makes tiffr different?</h1>
    <p>We love film and the excitement of the festival, but we were frustrated by the amount of time it would take to create a schedule from the hundreds of films available at the Toronto International Film Festival each year. So we built tiffr and put it online with little to no fanfare. Over four years, we've amassed a small but very loyal group of users who love what we're doing.</p>

    <p>We believe that a streamlined festival experience can translate into more sales and fewer empty seats.</p>
