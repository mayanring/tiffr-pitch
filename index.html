      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>We love film and the excitement of the festival, but we were frustrated by the amount of time it would take to create an itinerary from the hundreds of films showing at the Toronto International Film Festival each year. So we built the first version of tiffr to solve the problem for ourselves and shared it online with little to no fanfare. Over the last four years, we've amassed a modest but very loyal group of users who love what we're doing: taking what was once a daunting and time-consuming process and making it fun!</p>

      <p>Now we want to build out the platform to serve other festivals.</p>

      <p>We believe that a streamlined festival experience can translate into more sales and fewer empty seats.</p>
