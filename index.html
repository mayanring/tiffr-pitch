      <h1>Who are you guys?</h1>
      <p>We are Ryan Ming and Mina Mikhail, Toronto-based engineers, designers and film buffs with our fair share of experience working in the film and video-on-demand industries.</p>

      <p>We love film and the excitement of the festival, but we were frustrated by the amount of time it would take to create a personal schedule from the hundreds of films showing at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) each year. We built the first version of Rushline (as <a href="http://tiffr.com" target="_blank">tiffr.com</a>) to save ourselves some time and grey hairs. Over the last four years, we've amassed a modest but very loyal group of users who love what we're doing: taking what was once a daunting and time-consuming process and making it fun!</p>

      <p>Now we want to build out the platform to serve other festivals because we believe that a streamlined festival experience can translate into more sales and fewer empty seats.</p>
